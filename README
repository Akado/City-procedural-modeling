#######################################

This program is able to generate randomly a very large (max 100 km2) low-poly city.
There is 3 types of zones (commercial,residential & industrial) and all of them have their own generation rules.
The code is written in C++ and uses opengl.

Please look at the wiki to get an overview.

This program was realised during the first year of our computer science master.
